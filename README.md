# WPMB-Custom-Theme

## Intent
My goal is to build a light weight WordPress theme from scratch that meets *my* needs.

## Limitations
This theme will not be built with translation in mind.

The theme **requires** 3rd party plugins.
- ACF Pro
- Max Mega Menu

The theme will have styles for my other "plugins". It would be silly to add styles anywhere other than here. So, if you're going to use my CSS/SCSS but not all my plugins, you should deactivate what you're not using.
